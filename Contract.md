# Rules

## Meetings

30 min to 1 hr meetings in CS lab, weekly (more if needed), whenever schedules align (Thursdays?)
Agenda: Allison
Note-taker: Anika
Facilitators: Willan + Marc

## Communication

- Communicate through group chat
- Share work thru google folder/ github 
- Respect = be nice, be thoughtful, be considerate, don't be mean, it is okay to mess up :), ask questions, create a safe space for people to feel comfortable to voice their thoughts and opinions. We will ensure it stays respectful by setting group expectations surrounding what respect means and being mindful of other people’s opinions and thoughts. If necessary, feeling empowered to talk to the other person when boundaries are crossed.
- Notify group chat if you finish a task/ run into issues
- Talk during our weekly meetings. React to meeting invites, respond to people’s messages 
- Check in with the teammate to see if they are doing okay. 

## Technologies

Google drive/shared drive + docs, Github, text message to communicate

## Decision-Making

Unanimous vote (compromise if we cannot reach a unanimous decision)

## Delegation

- Based off of strengths, fairness/equal contribution, interest
- We will create a shared document with action items/weekly agenda to ensure that everyone is clear of their roles and responsibilities and when they need to get them done by.
- Share our progress and what we did before each meeting, next steps, and ask people for their opinion on direction. Team members can ask questions, give suggestions, or help if the person is stuck 
- Spend time required to finish delegated tasks and communicate if not able to finish or need help because it is longer or harder than expected

## Conflict Resolution

- What process will you follow if someone does not live up to their responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team?
	- Reach out to the individual, ask if they are stuck or confused, or if something is going in their schedule/ other obstacles preventing them from completing responsibilities/ standards set by the team
	- If individual responds, create a plan for future 
	- If the individual is not responding, give them an ultimatum. Ask them to please do their work, respond by a certain time, or else we will take further measures.
	- If they are still not communicating, reach out to the professor and ask for guidance on future steps to help keep the team on track. 

- How will you address conflict or deal with disagreements within the team?Other team members can help mediate discussion and make sure it remains civil and respectful
	- Be open to other people’s perspectives and compromise 
	- Find a common ground
